### Using CloudCannon

Getting a website online and updatable is easy with CloudCannon.

1. Sync website files to CloudCannon with GitHub, Bitbucket, Dropbox or a file upload.

2. CloudCannon makes your website live on a generated subdomain (*.cloudvent.net) or your own domain name.

3. Add `class="editable"` to elements in the HTML you want to be updatable.

4. Share the site with the rest of the team.

Other developers have full access to the source code. Non-developers can easily manage the content of site without writing code.
