## Who is CloudCannon for?

CloudCannon allows non-technical teams to take control of their website and developers to build websites faster. Agencies are using CloudCannon to deliver updatable websites to clients. Enterprises have their marketing teams update websites without interrupting developers.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator. What this really means is that Jekyll takes your content written in HTML, Markdown and other markup languages, passes it through templates and outputs a completely static website.

With Jekyll you can do things you would normally need a backend for. Blogging, photo galleries, and layouts are all possible.

CloudCannon runs Jekyll version **2.4.0**

## How does CloudCannon work?

Getting a website online and updatable is easy with CloudCannon.

1. The website files are synced to CloudCannon using GitHub, Bitbucket, Dropbox or a File Upload.

2. CloudCannon makes your website live on a generated subdomain (*.cloudvent.net) or your own domain name.

3. Add `class="editable"` to elements in the HTML you want to be updatable.

4. Share the site with the rest of the team.

Other developers get full access to the source code. Non-technical users can easily manage the content of site without writing code.
