<p> You can host your website on any external hosting provider with FTP support and still use CloudCannon for easy editing. CloudCannon initally pulls in your website files then any changes made on CloudCannon are pushed back. </p>

<p><strong> Note: CloudCannon does not continuously sync with FTP after the inital pull. You should make all future uploads and updates on CloudCannon to ensure both sides stay in sync.</strong> </p>

<h4> Connecting FTP </h4>

<p> Go to Storage Providers in your website configuration and click Connect next to FTP. </p>

<p> Fill out the FTP details using the details given by your hosting provider. The initial path is usually /public_html or /htdocs.</p>

<p> This will bring up a dialog asking what the main source is for the initial synchronization. This only matters if you have existing files in CloudCannon or FTP, select the source of files you want to keep. Click Connect FTP. </p>
