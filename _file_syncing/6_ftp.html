<p> FTP is another way of syncing files to CloudCannon. You can host your website on any hosting provider with FTP support and use CloudCannon for easy editing. CloudCannon initally pulls in your website then any changes made on CloudCannon will be pushed back. </p>

<p><strong> Note: CloudCannon does not continously sync with FTP after the inital pull so all changes should be done on CloudCannon to ensure both sides stay in sync.</strong> </p>

<h4> Connecting FTP </h4>

<p> Go to your website configuration and go to storage providers and click Connect next to FTP. </p>

<p> Fill out the FTP details using the details given by your hosting provider. The initial path is usually /public_html or /htdocs.</p>

<p> This will bring up a dialog asking what the main source is for the initial synchronization. This only matters if you have existing files in CloudCannon or FTP, select the source of files you want to keep. Click Connect FTP. </p>
