Only available for sites hosted by CloudCannon
{: .info}

We automatically perform optimisations on CloudCannon sites to make the websites load as fast as possible. These optimisations start running roughly 5 minutes after you've updated your website.

Local website assets referenced in the HTML and CSS are served by our CDN.

We also minify the CSS files using [clean-css](https://github.com/GoalSmashers/clean-css) and the Javascript using [Uglifier](https://github.com/lautis/uglifier).
