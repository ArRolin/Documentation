title: Creating New Folders
---

<p> Cloud Cannon ignores empty folders in the File Browser. It is possible however to create new folders directly in CloudCannon's File Browser. To add a new folder you must simultaneously create the folder and move another file or folder into it. To do this, select an existing file or folder in the File Browser and open it's dropdown menu at upper right. Select the "Move to a new folder" option and enter the name of the new folder when prompted.
