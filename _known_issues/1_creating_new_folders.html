title: Creating New Folders
---

<p> It is possible to create new folders directly in CloudCannon's File Browser. However, the File Browser doesn't handle empty folders very well/at all - it likes to delete them immediately.</p>

<p> The workaround for this is that every file and folder in the File Browser has the option to "Move to A New Folder" in it's upper right dropdown menu. There you can specify the name of a new folder you wish to move the selected item to. This action will simultaneously create a new folder AND move the selected item to that folder, satisfying our File Browser that there are no empty folders.</p>
