title: Testing Domains
---

With every CloudCannon site there is a matching .cloudvent url. This is used to test your live site at any stage.

Testing domains are generated using an adjective and a noun. A couple examples are red-lobster.cloudvent.net and fast-bean.cloudvent.net.

If you want this to domain to stop serving content add password authentication or contact support.
