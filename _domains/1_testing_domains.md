title: Testing Domains
---


Every CloudCannon site has a matching **.cloudvent** URL. This is used to test your live site at any stage.

Testing domains are generated using an adjective and a noun. For example, are **red-lobster.cloudvent.net** and **fast-bean.cloudvent.net**.

To stop serving content on this domain add [password authentication](/authentication/password/) or [contact support](mailto:support@cloudcannon.com).

## Agency Domains

To brand agency sites before sharing it with the client:

1. Create a site which may get **orange-helicopter.cloudvent.net** as a testing domain
3. [Sets up a subdomain](/domains/custom-domains/) at **client-name.agency-domain.com**
4. Share **client-name.agency-domain.com** instead of **orange-helicopter.cloudvent.net**

CloudCannon supports multiple sites on a single domain, read [the subdomains section](/domains/subdomains/) for more.
