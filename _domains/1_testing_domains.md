title: Testing Domains
---


With every CloudCannon site there is a matching .cloudvent url. This is used to test your live site at any stage.

Testing domains are generated using an adjective and a noun. A couple examples are red-lobster.cloudvent.net and fast-bean.cloudvent.net.

If you want this to domain to stop serving content add password authentication or contact support.

## Using Agency Domains

Agencies like to brand their client sites before going sharing it with the client. For example:

1. An agency (agency.com) is building the site bobs-bakery.com
2. They create a site which gets orange-helicopter.cloudvent.net testing domain
3. The agency [sets up a subdomain bobs-bakery.agency.com](/domains/custom-domains/)
4. The client gets shared bobs-bakery.agency.com instead of orange-helicopter.cloudvent.net

CloudCannon supports multiple sites on a single domain, read [the subdomains section](/domains/subdomains/) for more.
