Anyone can view your site with no authentication. If you are making a public facing website this is the setting you want.

No authentication is the default state for your site.
{: .info}

All prototyping sites with no authentication will have a splash screen before visitors can see your site.
You can use authentication while prototyping instead, limiting the access to your team and clients.
