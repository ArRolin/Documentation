title: Password Sharing
---

Share your site to people without them having to create a CloudCannon account.

Go to the password sharing tab in site settings and enter a password:

![Password sharing](/img/sharing/5.png){: .screenshot}

Send your clients the website URL with **/update** on the end (e.g. `mysite.com/update`) and the password. They can log in and do everything a Content Writer can.

Password sharing is useful for users who need the simplest workflow possible (e.g. small business owners who aren't confident with different online tools).
