<p> You can email your clients the website url with /update on the end  (e.g. mysite.com/update) and the password. They can log in and do everything a Content Writer can. </p> 

<p> Password sharing is useful for users who need the simplest workflow possible (e.g. small business owners who aren't confident with different online tools). A major downside of using password sharing is that WHO makes changes is not recorded. </p>
