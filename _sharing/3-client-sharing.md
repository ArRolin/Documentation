title: Client Sharing
---

Share your site with your clients without them having to create a CloudCannon account and use a seat on your pricing plan.

Go to the Client Sharing tab in site settings and enter a password:

![Password sharing](/img/sharing/5.png){: .screenshot}

Send your clients the website URL with **/update** on the end (e.g. `mysite.com/update`) and have them enter the password. Once they've logged in, your client gets a stripped back interface for editing content on their site
