title: Password Sharing
---

You can also share you site to people without them having to create a CloudCannon account.

Go to the password sharing tab in site settings and enter a password:

<img alt="Password developer" src="/img/sharing/5.png" class="screenshot">

You can email your clients the website url with /update on the end  (e.g. `mysite.com/update`) and the password. They can log in and do everything a Content Writer can.

Password sharing is useful for users who need the simplest workflow possible (e.g. small business owners who aren't confident with different online tools).
