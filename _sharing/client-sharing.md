Share your site with your clients without them having to create a CloudCannon account and use a seat on your pricing plan.

Go to the *Site Settings* / *Client Sharing* section and enter a password:

![Password sharing](/img/sharing/5.png){: .screenshot}

Send your clients the website URL with **/update** on the end (e.g. `http://mysite.com/update`) and have them enter the password. Once they've logged in, your client gets a stripped back interface for editing content on their site.

### Interface

Customise the interface for your clients. You can provide documentation and support URLs. The support URL can be a `mailto:` link.

The preview URL overrides the link to the live site in the sidebar and header. It is useful for sites hosted externally or with redirects.

To change the URLs:

1. Go to the *Site Settings* / *Client Interface* section
2. Enter the desired URLs
3. Click **Update Client Interface**
