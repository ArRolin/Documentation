Remove all CloudCannon logos and brand it as your own.

Upload a logo in Account Settings:

![Client sharing](/img/sharing/upload-white-label-logo.png){: .screenshot}

Now when you use [Client Sharing](/sharing/client-sharing/) there's no CloudCannon branding and your logo shows on the login screen.

![Client sharing](/img/sharing/client-white-label.png){: .screenshot}
