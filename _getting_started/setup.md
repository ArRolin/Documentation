It's possible to work entirely in CloudCannon. However for this guide, we'll set up a local environment so you can get used to a typical developers workflow.

### Installation

Jekyll has a few dependencies including Ruby and Node.js. Follow the instructions for your OS.

#### OSX
{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install jekyll -v 2.4.0
{% endhighlight %}

#### Ubuntu
{% highlight bash %}
$ apt-get install ruby ruby-dev make gcc nodejs
$ gem install jekyll
{% endhighlight %}

#### Windows
Windows is not officially supported but [there is a workaround](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/).
