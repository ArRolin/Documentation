Uploading files in the browser is the fastest way to get a website going on CloudCannon. To upload additional files to a site that already has previous uploads click on the upload button in the top right of the file browser.

Then choose if you want to select individual files or upload a whole folder.

Once you've made a selection it will upload to CloudCannon. If you have a cloud storage provider connected CloudCannon will push the file there as well.
