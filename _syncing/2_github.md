You'll be redirected back to CloudCannon to pick a repository to connect. If you don't have one for this website, create a new one in GitHub and refresh this page.

A dialog box will appear asking for the master source for the initial synchronization. This only matters if you have existing files in CloudCannon or your repository. The arrow shows the direction of file transfer and points to the source that will be overwritten. Click "Connect GitHub".

GitHub is now connected. Changes you push to the Git Repository are pulled in by CloudCannon. Any changes made on CloudCannon are automatically committed and pushed.
