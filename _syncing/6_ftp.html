<p> You can host your website on any external hosting provider with FTP support and still use CloudCannon for easy editing. CloudCannon initially pulls in your website files then any changes made on CloudCannon are pushed back. </p>

<p class="error">CloudCannon does not continuously sync with FTP after the initial pull. You should make all future uploads and updates on CloudCannon to ensure both sides stay in sync.</p>

<h4> Connecting FTP </h4>

<p> Go to Storage Providers in your website configuration and click "Connect" next to FTP. </p>

<p> Fill out the FTP details using the details given by your hosting provider. The initial path is usually /public_html or /htdocs.</p>

<p> A dialog box will appear asking for the master source for the initial synchronization. This only matters if you have existing files in CloudCannon or FTP. The arrow shows the direction of file transfer and points to the source that will be overwritten. Click "Connect FTP". </p>

<p> Now any updates you make in CloudCannon are pushed to your hosting provider using FTP.</p>
