This overview will give you a glimpse of the features on CloudCannon and walk you through the different editing modes.

Download the [Creative site](/creative.zip).

This website started off as a free template. It's been converted to a Jekyll website with a blog, layouts and other features. For a full walkthrough on how to do this check out [Jekyll.tips](http://jekyll.tips).

Sign up for a CloudCannon account.

Create a new site.

Now we need to upload our site to CloudCannon. There's a few ways of doing this. We could sync with GitHub, BitBucket or Dropbox. For this site we'll just upload the files from our computer.

Click the file upload button.

Go to upload folder (This is only supported in some browsers. If it's grayed out use one of the storage providers mentioned above).

![Upload Folder](/img/overview/upload_folder.png)

All the files are in CloudCannon now.

Click on `index.html`. This opens the website in a live preview. You can navigate around the site as if it's a live website.

Go to the Visual Editor at the top right. In the Visual Editor you can make content changes inline on the website. The yellow boxes indicate the updatable areas of the page.

Front Matter is a Jekyll feature which allows you to configure variables like the page title on a page. CloudCannon provides the settings view which allows you to easily make updates to the front matter.

Go to the Code Editor at the top right. The Code Editor gives access to the source code of the site. Notice how the h1 and p have `class="editable"`, this is how you control what elements can be updated in the Visual Editor.

Let's get into some blogging. Click the Collections tab on the left. This will bring up your draft posts.

![Draft Posts](/img/overview/draft_posts.png)

Click on the draft post. This will open it up in a beautiful Markdown editor. Try making a few edits and clicking Publish Post when you're finished.

To finish off the tutorial we'll go through Collections. Collections are a way of grouping related data, on this site we're using it to list the services this agency offers.

Click Collections and go to services. You can update items in the collection in a similar way to the blog post.

That's it for the overview. You can view the live website by clicking the *yoursite*.cloudvent.net link at the top of CloudCannon.
