## What is CloudCannon?

CloudCannon is a cloud based CMS and hosting provider for static and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) websites. CloudCannon manages all the technical details of deploying and scaling websites and offers a simple interface for content updates.

## Who is CloudCannon for?

CloudCannon is focussed on bringing developers and non-technical people together. Agencies are using CloudCannon to deliver updatable websites to clients. Enterprises have their marketing teams update websites without interrupting developers.

#### What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator. What this really means is that Jekyll is a program that takes your content written in HTML, Markdown and other markup languages, passes it through templates and outputs a completely static website.

## How does CloudCannon work?

Getting a website online and updatable is easy with CloudCannon.

1. The website files are synced to CloudCannon using Github, BitBucket, Dropbox or a File Upload.

2. CloudCannon makes your website live on a generated subdomain (*.cloudvent.net) or your own domain name.

3. Add `class="editable"` to elements in the HTML you want to be updatable.

4. Share the site with the rest of the team.

Other developers get full access to the source code. Non-technical users can easily manage the content of site without writing code.
