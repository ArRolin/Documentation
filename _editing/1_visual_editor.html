<p> The Visual Editor is the main way to edit content in CloudCannon. Areas you can update (or editable regions as we call them) are indicated by yellow boxes. To an update, click inside a yellow box and update the content inline. </p> 

<p>You can navigate to other pages by simply clicking links on the site. </p>
