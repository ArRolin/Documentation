This feature is only available on Jekyll sites.

Collections are used to organise content, similar to blogging, except the content isn't organised by date.

There's lots of great use cases for collections: API documentation, products, albums. Basically anywhere you have structured data which repeats itself.

In this example we'll create a collection to organise and display staff members.

To define the staff collection we need to set it in `_config.yml` :

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
collections:
  staff:
    output: true
defaults:
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: "staff"
    values:
      layout: "staff_member"
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

I've set a staff collection with `output: true`. Output true means Jekyll will generate a page for each item in the collection. I'm doing this because there's going to be a page for each staff member with a full bio.

The defaults section tells Jekyll to use the staff_member layout for pages generated in the staff collection. I could define the layout on each collection item but it's always going to be the staff_member layout, so it's easier to set it as a default.

Now in the root of the website we'll create a folder `_staff` and add `elon.md` with the following content:

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
---
name: Elon Musk
position: CEO
twitter_handle: "@elonmusk"
profile_photo_path: http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/wiredscience/2012/10/ff_musk4_f.jpg
---
Born in South Africa in 1971 Elon Musk was raised in Pretoria by a South African engineer father, Errol Musk, and Canadian born Pennsylvania Dutch, nutritionist and author mother, Maye. As he grew up he dreamed of moving to the US where he believed “anything is possible.” His first stop though was Canada where he spent two years at Queens University in Kingston Ontario.
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Next let's create `/staff.html` and print out all the staff members (there's only one at this stage) using liquid:

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
---
layout: default
---
<ul class="staff">
  {% for staff_member in site.staff %}
    <li>
      <div class="profile_image">
        <img src="{{ staff_member.profile_photo_path }}" alt="{{ staff_member.name}}" />
      </div>
      <p><a href="{{staff_member.url}}">{{ staff_member.name}} - <strong>{{ staff_member.position }}</strong></a></p>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Notice the `staff_member.url`. This links to the generated page for the staff member. It's automatically generated by Jekyll because we've set `output: true` on the collection.

Now we need to define the staff_member layout in `_layouts/staff_member.html`. This is the layout the generated staff pages use:

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
---
layout: default
---
<div class="profile_image">
  <img src="{{ page.profile_photo_path }}" alt="{{ page.name}}" />
</div>
<h2> {{ page.name }} - <strong> {{ page.position }} </h2>
<p> Twitter Handle - {{ page.twitter_handle }} </p>
<p>{{ page.content }}</p>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


All collections defined in `_config.yml` appear in the **Collections** tab on CloudCannon. From here you can add a new item to the collection by clicking a button, the front matter is copied from an existing collection item.

You can edit the collection item with the Markdown editor. All front matter can be updated as well.

If it's an HTML file the output set to 'true' in in `_config.yml`, the Visual Editor can be used with Editable Regions.

If output set to 'false' on an HTML collection item, only the Code Editor can be used.
