warning: This feature is only available on Jekyll sites.

Collections are used to organize content, sort of like blogging, except that the content isn't blog posts. Each Collection you define in your `_config.yml` will be in the **Collection** tab in CloudCannon.

If an item in a Collection is a Markdown file you can edit it with our Markdown editor.

If it's an HTML file and your have the output set to 'true' in in `_config.yml` you can use the Visual Editor with Editable Regions. If you don't have output set to 'true' you can only use the Code Editor.
