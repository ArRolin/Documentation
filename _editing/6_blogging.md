To blog on your site you first need to create a `_posts` folder in the root of your Jekyll website.

Go to the "Collections" tab for your website where there will be two items: Draft Posts and Published Posts. Draft posts are hidden when your site is published.

Let's add a new Draft post. Click the **Start a new draft** button and enter a title for the post.

Now click on the file you've just created. It'll open our stripped-back markdown editor. Enter the content for your blog post here.

If you ever want to see the raw Markdown go to the Code Editor.  </p>

You can always configure the layout, blog title and any other Front Matter you've defined by going to the **Settings** tab.
