#### Static vs Jekyll

CloudCannon supports two types of websites, static and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). To turn on Jekyll integration CloudCannon looks for `_config.yml` in the root of your website.

#### What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator. What this really means is that Jekyll is a program that takes your content written in HTML, Markdown and other markup languages, passes it through templates and outputs a completely static website.

To get started with Jekyll checkout out [Jekyll.tips](http://jekyll.tips).

#### What does CloudCannon's Jekyll integration do?

**Simple Editing** - Jekyll has no easy way for non-technical users to update content themselves. With CloudCannon non-technical users can manage all content on their websites.

**Jekyll builds in the cloud** - Jekyll sites are normally compiled locally and then uploaded to a webserver. This requires setting up a ruby environment to run Jekyll. Users that wish to avoid setting up this environment can use CloudCannon to build Jekyll sites in the cloud.

#### Jekyll Version

CloudCannon runs Jekyll version 2.4.0. There is currently no support for external Jekyll plugins.
