<p>CloudCannon's visual editor works with javascript as long as the editable content is in on the page at page load. If you are rendering html using javascript, that html will not be editable as there is nowhere to save the content back to. You can relocate editable regions, show and hide, and generate the rest of the page  as long as the editable html as somewhere to save to.</p>
