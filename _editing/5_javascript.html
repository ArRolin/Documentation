<p>CloudCannon's visual editor works with JavaScript, you just need to make sure that the editable content is there at page load. HTML that you render with JavaScript will not be editable because there is nowhere to save the content back to. You can achieve your layout with JavaScript by relocating editable regions, show and hide, and generating the rest of the page, as long as the editable HTML as somewhere to save to.</p>
