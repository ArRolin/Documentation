<h4> Adding a new Jekyll site </h4>

<p> Creating a new Jekyll site is no different to adding a standard static website to CloudCannon. You can follow those steps until you have uploaded files.</p>

<p> Once files are uploaded CloudCannon will detect if there is a _config.yml file present. If _config.yml is preent CloudCannon will display the interfaces to Jekyll beta users for Jekyll functionality outlined below.</p>
