<h4> Adding a new Jekyll site </h4>

<p> Creating a new Jekyll site is no different to adding a standard static website to CloudCannon. You can follow those steps until you have successfully uploaded files.</p>

<p> When files are uploaded CloudCannon will detect if the _config.yml file present in all Jekyll sites is there and if so display the interfaces to Jekyll beta users for Jekyll functionality outlined below.</p>
