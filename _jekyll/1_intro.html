<h4> What is Jekyll? </h4>

<p> Jekyll is a static site generator. What this really means is that Jekyll is a program that takes your content written in HTML, Markdown and other markup languages, passes it through templates and outputs a completely static website. </p>

<p> The advantages of doing this are: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>It's simple</strong> - Jekyll is a small step up from HTML so there's not huge amount to learn.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Secure </strong> - You don't need to worry about the latest PHP vulnerability or if your site has a security hole. Your site is just static files which makes it much harder to find security holes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Fast </strong> - There's no backend processing or database to access to generate your site, so Jekyll websites are extremely fast.
  </li>

  <li> <strong> It's powerful </strong> - Jekyll opens up a world of new possibilities on static websites. You can blog, have templates, it's hard to believe these are just static websites. </li>
</ul>

<h4> What does CloudCannon's Jekyll integration do? </h4>

<p> Client editing - To date one of the major downsides of using Jekyll has been that there is no easy way for non-technical users to update content themselves. </p>

<p> CloudCannon changes this. On CloudCannon you can add all the normal CloudCannon editing features to a Jekyll website. CloudCannon also allows non-technical users to blog, manage collections, front matter and data.</p>

<p> Jekyll compilation in the cloud - Jekyll sites are normally compiled locally and then uploaded to a webserver. This requires setting up a ruby environment to run Jekyll. Users that wish to avoid setting up this environment or cannot ["(Jekyll is not officially supported on Windows)"](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/), can use CloudCannon to compile Jekyll in the cloud.</p>

<h4> Jekyll on CloudCannon </h4>

<p> CloudCannon runs Jekyll version 2.4.0. There is currently no support for external Jekyll plugins. </p>
