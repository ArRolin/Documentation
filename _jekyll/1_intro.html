<h4> What is Jekyll? </h4>

<p> Jekyll is a static site generator. What that means is it takes your content written in HTML, Markdown and other markup languages, passes it through templates and outputs a completley static website </p>

<p> The advantages of doing this are: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>It's simple</strong> - Jekyll is a small step up from HTML so there's not huge amount to learn.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Secure </strong> - You don't need to worry about the latest PHP vunribility or if your site has an security hole. Your site is just static files which makes it much harder to find security holes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Fast </strong> - There's no backend processing or database to access to generate your site, so Jekyll websites are extremly fast.
  </li>

  <li> <strong> It's powerful </strong> - Jekyll opens up a world of new possibilites on static websites. You can blog, have templates, it's hard to belive these are just static websites. </li>
</ul>
