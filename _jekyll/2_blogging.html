<p> To blog on your site you first need to create a _posts folder in the root of your Jekyll website. </p>

<p> Go to the "Collections" tab for your website where there will be two items: Draft Posts and Published Posts. Draft posts are hidden when your site is published. </p>

<p> Let's add a new Draft post. Click the "Start a new draft" button and enter a title for the post. </p>

<p> Now click on the file you've just created. It'll open our stripped-back markdown editor. Enter the content for your blog post here.  </p>

<p> If you ever want to see the raw markdown (and you're not a <a href="#sharing1_share_with_content_writerhtml">Content Writer</a>), go to the Code Editor.  </p>

<p> You can always configure the layout, blog title and any other Front Matter you've defined by going to the "Settings" tab. </p>
