<p> We've tried to make the Jekyll integration "just work" as much as possible. We're still working to make it even easier.

<h4> Templates / Includes </h4>

<p> At the moment you can't have editable/repeatable regions inside a template or include. It must be in the main content. If you need to add updatable content to a template or include, try using a collection. We're working to make this possible in the future. </p>

<h4> Compiling </h4>

<p> Each time you make an edit, CloudCannon has to recompile the website before we can show it in the Visual Editor. It usually takes a few seconds. We'll be making this even faster in the future. </p>
