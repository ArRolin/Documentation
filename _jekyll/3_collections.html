<p> 'Collections' are used to organise content, sort of like blogging, except that the content isn't blog posts. Each Collection you define in your _config.yml will be in the Collection tab in CloudCannon. </p>

<p> If an item in a Collection is a Markdown file you can edit it with our Markdown editor. </p>

<p> If it's an HTML file and your have the output set to 'true' in in your _config.yml you can use the Visual Editor with Editable Regions. If you don't have output set to 'true' you can only use the Code Editor. </p>
