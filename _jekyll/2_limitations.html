title: Limitations
---

<p> We've tried to make the Jekyll integration "just work", however there are some limitations to be aware of.

<h4> Templates / Includes </h4>

<p> You can't have editable/repeatable regions inside a template or include. It must be in the main content. If you need to add updatable content to a template or include, try using a collection </p>

<h4> Compiling </h4>

<p> Each time you make an edit, CloudCannon has to recompile the website before we can show it in the Visual Editor. It usually takes a few seconds </p>
