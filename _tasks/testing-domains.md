title: Testing Domains
---
All sites on CloudCannon&#39;s receive a free testing .cloudvent.net subdomain.&nbsp;This allows you to see that site live on the web, even if you haven&#39;t purchased a permanent domain for the project yet. (Free plan sites must have a password set to view the site on this subdomain; Paying users may choose to set a site password or not).

These subdomains are automatically generated with the format of &#39;{ADJECTIVE}-{NOUN}.cloudvent.net&#39;

It is not possible to change the automatically generated subdomain.

If you wish to use more professional custom testing domains for client projects try the following method:

#### Subdomains for client testing

Let&#39;s pretend that I own a web design agency&nbsp;and my domain is SamBonney.com. I&nbsp;have made a new site for a client called &#39;Swish Barber&#39;.&nbsp;To create the subdomain for testing swishbarber.sambonney.com I&nbsp;would:

*   create the Swish Barber site as&nbsp;a separate&nbsp;site in CloudCannon
*   upload the site files
*   upgrade the site plan
*   go into Custom Domain settings
*   type in swishbarber.sambonney.com&nbsp;and &quot;claim&quot; that subdomain for that site.
*   then go to my own DNS and add the A record that CloudCannon gives&nbsp;for that site under the subdomain.
