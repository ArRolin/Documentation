title: Includes
---

<p>Having the same header/footer across multiple pages can be a hassle when you want to make an update to your template. That's why CloudCannon has an 'include' feature. On any HTML page you can use the following syntax to include any text based file <code>&lt;!-- include another_file.html --&gt;</code>.</p>

<p class="error">The include feature is deprecated, use Jekyll includes instead.</p>
<p class="warning">Editable regions cannot be used in includes.</p>

<p>Here's an example of how you would have a static header / footer across multiple pages:</p>

<p>First create four files - header.html, footer.html, index.html and about.html.</p>

<p>In header.html put the following:</p>

{% highlight html %}
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <div id="navigation">
            <a href="index.html">Home</a>
            <a href="about.html">About</a>
        </div>

        <div id="content">
{% endhighlight %}

<p>And in footer.html put the following:</p>
{% highlight html %}
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now we can include the header and footer into our other HTML pages. Let's start with the <span class="url">index.html</span> page:</p>

{% highlight html %}
<!-- include header.html -->
<h1> My Home page </h1>
<!-- include footer.html -->
{% endhighlight %}

<p>and the about page:</p>

{% highlight html %}
<!-- include header.html -->
<h1> About Page </h1>
<!-- include footer.html -->
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now when you makes changes to header.html, it will update on the index and about pages.</p>
